The Setup Process
=============================

**Recommended Programs**
-----------------------------

FL Studio or GarageBand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FL Studio is a program for Windows and MacOS for editing/developing music. The trial version is free and unlimited, but it does not save projects (although you can still export the project). Therefore, if you intend to use this trial to listen to and/or edit music, you need to start and complete your work in one sitting.

GarageBand is a similar program, but for MacOS only. This will work perfectly fine, though our guide on this website is aimed mostly at FL Studio, as it is cross-platform.

A Media Player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any MP3/WAV media player will work perfectly fine. If you're using Windows 10/11, you most likely have one installed already (in the form of Windows Media Player). 

If you do not have one installed, VLC is an open-source media player that works perfectly for this scenario, as well as for visual media.


**How To Get A Particular Result**
---------------------------------

Music With A Particular Emotion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lots of music evokes a particular emotion from the listener. Some music is sad and slow, or fast and upbeat.  

If you have a particular desired emotion for the song, then you may want to consider the settings used in the program. Songs in a minor key can often be scary, sad, or off putting in some way. 


Music With A Particular Note or Chord
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While our program does not currently allow you to input a specific note/chord to use, you will find that many bass/appregio structures are based on common chords. Until further inputs are developed, please continue trying for new sounds until you find the one you are looking for.
